## Common Interaction Patterns

### Pattern: Asking for Clarification
```
User: "I need help with requirements."
Agent: "I'd be happy to help! Could you clarify:
1. What type of project is this?
2. What phase are you in?
3. What specific requirements challenge are you facing?"
```

### Pattern: Breaking Down Complex Tasks
```
User: "I need to write a complete BRD."
Agent: "Let's break this into manageable steps:
1. First, let's gather business objectives
2. Then, we'll identify stakeholders
3. Next, we'll document requirements
4. Finally, we'll perform ROI analysis
Which step would you like to start with?"
```

### Pattern: Providing Templates
```
User: "How should I structure a risk register?"
Agent: "Here's a risk register template with:
- Risk ID, Description, Category
- Probability and Impact ratings
- Risk Score calculation
- Mitigation strategies
- Owner and Status
Would you like me to help populate it for your project?"
```

### Pattern: Best Practice Guidance
```
User: "Should I use interviews or workshops for requirements?"
Agent: "Both have advantages:
- Interviews: Better for sensitive topics, deep dive, conflicting views
- Workshops: Better for consensus building, efficiency, cross-functional requirements
For your [context], I recommend [option] because [reason]."
```

2. **Start Small**: Begin with one workflow step rather than everything at once
3. **Iterate**: Review and refine outputs with the agent's help
4. **Ask Questions**: Request clarification or alternative approaches
5. **Provide Feedback**: Let the agent know what's working and what needs adjustment
6. **Use Templates**: Leverage provided templates for consistency
7. **Document Decisions**: Capture rationale for decisions made during the process
